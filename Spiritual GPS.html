    <h1>Spiritual GPS</h1>
    <h3>Gal 5:16  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh. </h3>

    <h2>First Birth: Born of The Flesh</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Everyone Is Born The Same</span> <b>We have no knowledge of the world around us.</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">We must learn to walk and Talk</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Eventually We learn To Dress Ourselves</span> <b>Draw off my own daughters dressing themselves</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">As adults we try to navigate this World and find our places in it</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">We All Make Mistakes</span> Some of us more than others, but through ignorance or on purpose we all fall down, many times in life.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sometimes its through Sin</span> The Bible teaches that we all sin and all fall short of the glory of God <b>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God;</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sometimes We just dont know better</span> Alot of times we navigate through life through trial and error. When we fall its just through us learning are way around</li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Concrete Self Image</span> Often times we give ourselves labels that we think cannot change:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Impatient</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Short tempered</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Anxious</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Criminal</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Etc</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">But Then We Hear The Gospel</span> All of our lives we think of ourselves through the lens of our self-image we have built for ourselves. Then one day, a truth comes that has the power to shatter our self image and unlocks the ability to become a new person all together. <b>John 3:7 "...Ye must be born again."</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Your current self-image does not matter</span> It does not matter if you classify yourselves as any of the following: <b>Gal 5:19  Now the works of the flesh are manifest, which are these; Adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness,  Gal 5:20  Idolatry, witchcraft, hatred, variance, emulations, wrath, strife, seditions, heresies,  Gal 5:21  Envyings, murders, drunkenness, revellings, and such like: of the which I tell you before, as I have also told you in time past, that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God;</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You can be New, Reborn!</span> <b>2Co 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new;</b></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Your Past Does Not Make Your Future</span> Through Christ's suffering and shed blood, we have a new life, completely free from our pasts. <b>Rom 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;</b></li>
    </ul>

    <h2>New Birth: Born of The Spirit</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">This Lesson is For Those That Have Been Born a 2nd Time</span> All have been born of the water, but have you been born of the Spirit? <b>Rom 8:1  There is therefore now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus, who walk not after the flesh, but after the Spirit;</b></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Those Born In Christ Must Learn:</span></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">To Walk and Talk as a New Creation</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">To Dress Like a Christian</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">To Live As A Christian</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Your Saying Christ Cares About How You Present Yourselves</span> Yes, Christ cares because you are to show others the light. If the world looks at you and sees more of what they already know then what would cause them to think they can escape their bondage by following Christ through your example.</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">You are the only Bible that some people will ever read</span> That means your walk, though not perfect, should be so much in step with God that people have a hard time distinguishing from you and Jesus <b>"Ye are the light of the world. A city that is set on a hill cannot be hid." (Matthew 5:14, KJV).</b></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">It Simply Requires A Desire To Be Different Than The Old You, and Willing To Receive Instruction</span> Sunday School is a place where you can come and receive instruction from God Himself, and allow His Holy Spirit to work in you and equip you for what you need to be that new you!</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">God's Promise of New</span> For the disciples of Christ, those that truly follow after Him He promises you:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">A New Life</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">A Purpose Filled Life</span> Don't you want to be apart of something bigger than yourself. God promises to use you in a great and mighty way <b>Jer 33:3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not;</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Peace And Joy</span> <b>Php 4:7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus;</b></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Christian's Daily Routine</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">A Christians Daily Preperation</span> Before we go out into the world we must prepare by putting on our armor <b>Eph 6:11  Put on the whole armour of God, that ye may be able to stand against the wiles of the devil;</b></li>
        <li><span class="highlight">The Armor Protects but the Spirit Guides</span> When we go out into the world, armor or not to the untrained Christian it can seem like we dont know the right way to go</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Battle of Isandlwana (22 January 1879)</span> In 1879 a confident British army, decked out in the latest gear and armed with the newest rifles, setting up camp in the vast plains of South Africa. They felt invincible, believing their modern weapons made them untouchable. But they were in unfamiliar territory, and they underestimated the heart and tactics of the Zulu warriors. The Zulus, though armed mainly with shields and spears, knew their homeland like the back of their hand. Using a strategy inspired by the buffalo's shape, they planned to surround the British. The main force would engage them head-on, while the "horns" of their formation would sneak around the sides. As the Zulus charged, the British were caught off guard. Their advanced weapons and armor were of little use when they didn't see the attack coming from all sides. In the chaos and dust, over a thousand British soldiers lost their lives, proving that a well armored military can be overtaken in unfamiliar territory</li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">How The Spiritual GPS Works</span> Walking In The Spirit Guides Us In 2 Ways:</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">It Restrains The Flesh</span> Are you getting victory over temptations. Those things that you know you shouldnt do but your flesh wants to do. We can be our own worst enemy <b>Gal 5:16  This I say then, Walk in the Spirit, and ye shall not fulfil the lust of the flesh;</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">It Produces Fruit</span> Are You producing fruit. Fruit is visible, everyone knows if an apple tree has apples. Can others testify to the fruit your producing. <b>The Characteristics of the fruit: Gal 5:22  But the FRUIT of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  Gal 5:23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">If Your Not Producing Fruit Your Not Walking In the Spirit - Thats the Guide</span> <b>Mat 7:13  Enter ye in at the strait gate: for wide is the gate, and broad is the way, that leadeth to destruction, and many there be which go in thereat;  Mat 7:14  Because strait is the gate, and narrow is the way, which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it;</b></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>The Characteristics of the Fruit</h2>
    <h2>Gal 5:22  But the FRUIT of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, longsuffering, gentleness, goodness, faith,  Gal 5:23  Meekness, temperance: against such there is no law.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">The fruit is from the same Plant</span> An Apple tree doesnt have multiple fruits, it has apples. <b>Gen 1:11  And God said, Let the earth bring forth grass, the herb yielding seed, and the fruit tree yielding fruit after his kind, whose seed is in itself, upon the earth: and it was so;</b></li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">This is the Unity of The Spirit</span></li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">The Fruit Has To Grow</span> Growth is painful sometimes, dark sometimes. Illustration: Consider a seed. Alone and seemingly insignificant, it holds within it the potential to become a mighty tree. But first, it must be buried in the darkness of the soil. Application: Like the seed, you might feel buried by your circumstances, but this is not the end. Just as the seed grows into a tree, with time, care, and nourishment, your situation can change, and you can rise again. The fruit of the Spirit can be your nourishment, guiding you towards growth and transformation.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">The Fruit Is Distinguishable</span> An apple looks like an apple, an orange looks like an orange, all accross the world. Christians do have characteristics that are similar regardless of differences in personalitiies</li>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Do people think Christian when your name crosses their minds?</span> <b>Act 11:26  And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch. And it came to pass, that a whole year they assembled themselves with the church, and taught much people. And the disciples were called Christians first in Antioch;</b></li>
        </ul>
    </ul>

    <h2>Conclusion: The Spiritual GPS: A Path to Transformation</h2>
    <h2>Navigating life without guidance is like being lost in an unfamiliar territory. Just as we needed guidance when we first entered this world, we also require divine direction on our spiritual journey. The Bible offers us a Spiritual GPS - a system that guides us, alerts us to danger, and ensures our alignment with our divine purpose. This guidance is crucial, especially when the terrains of life become challenging and uncertain.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Awareness of Our Current State</span> Every GPS system first determines your current location. We all start our spiritual journey being aware of our weaknesses, our sins, and our struggles. It's essential to acknowledge where we currently stand, to determine the direction we need to take.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Setting the Right Destination:</span> The Gospel introduces us to a new destination - one of salvation, transformation, and renewal. To follow this path, we must be willing to let go of our past and embrace our new identity in Christ.</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Following the Guide: </span> The Holy Spirit, our Spiritual GPS, constantly communicates with us. Through the Spirit, we learn to overcome the desires of the flesh, produce the fruit of righteousness, and stay on the path that God has set for us.</li>
    </ul>
