"Of course, I am a gambler; I will quit gambling and I will never touch a pack of cards." "All right; what else?" "I am a bad man, and I will live a clean life." "Good; what else?" He said, "If I quit these things, I think they cover about all. I will quit drinking, swearing, stop gambling, and I will quit being impure." Billy said, "Good. Give me your hand and say you will accept Jesus Christ as your Savior," He said, "No, I will not. If I stop those things, I wonâ€™t need to do that."</b> </li>

            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">We can Draw close Because God is First Drawn Close to us</span> <span>God the creator of the universe, allows us to have this relationship with Him because He desires it</span> <b>That means, that God is in pursuit of you. There is someone in this room no doubt that has been feeling the tug of God on their Heart. </b> </li>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">He doesnt say how much to Draw Close</span> <span>It doesnt matter if we are curious, or unable to come to God by large steps. </span> <b>God says, be sincere when you draw close to me and I will make up the difference</b> </li>

      <h2>How to Approach God</h2>
      <ul>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">1) You Must Be Saved</span> <span>If we are not careful we get hung up here growing up in America. Especially if you ever spent anytime in a na or aa meeting. You get it in your head that you can choose your higher power, and some of us just say okay I choose Jesus. The problem is that is not what God says salvation looks like</span> <b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am THE WAY, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">2) You Come to Church</span> <span></span> <b>If youre wondering why you dont feel God's presence in your life. When was the last time you woke up Sunday morning and said, Jesus, you have done so much for me I am going to hear your Word this morning.</b> </li>
         <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">I dont have a way to church, etc</span> <span></span> <b>Invitation to Gospel Light Baptist</b> </li>
         </ul>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">3) Constantly Seeking God's Forgiveness</span> <span>You know falling down and making mistakes is okay. The Bible says a righteous man falls 7 times and get's back up again. But do you bring it to God, seek His forgiveness for it.</span> <b>1Jn 1:9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Answer is Through Jesus Christ</span> <span></span> <b>Will you Draw Nigh to Him this morning</b> </li>
      </ul>
