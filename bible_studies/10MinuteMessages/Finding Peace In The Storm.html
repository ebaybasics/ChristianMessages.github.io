                    <h1>Finding Peace In The Storm</h1>
                    <h3>Php 4:7  And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. </h3>
            <h2>What is Peace?</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Our Passage is The conclusion to Paul's message to Philippians</span> <span></span> <b>Paul gave some instructions on how to be successful in the storms of this Christian life. He finishes by saying "THE PEACE OF GOD, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus." SO WHAT IS PEACE??</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Peace Illustrated: </span> <span></span> <b>Two painters were asked to paint a picture illustrating peace. The first painted a beautiful evening scene in the foreground of which was a lake, its surface absolutely calm and unruffled. Trees surrounded it, meadows stretched away to the distant cattle gently browsing; a little cottage, the setting sun-all spoke of perfect rest. The second painter drew a wild, stormy scene. Heavy black clouds hung overhead; in the center of the picture an immense waterfall poured forth huge volumes of water covered with foam. One could almost hear its unceasing roar, yet perhaps the first thing to strike the eye was a small bird, perched in a cleft of a huge rock, absolutely sheltered from all danger, pouring forth its sweet notes of joy. It is the second painter who could describe the peace that passeth all understanding which is the Lord Jesus Christ, the wisdom of God in the heart of the redeemed. One can only have peace with himself if he has peace with God.</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">To one man peace is the absence of storms, to the other peace is the refuge in the storm </span> <span></span> <b></b> </li></ul></ul><h2>1) There is Purpose in the Storm</h2><ul></ul><h2>Rom 8:28  And we know that all things work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpose. </h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Many in this room no doubt are facing a storm right now</span> <span></span> <b>Consider this storm a trial meant to put you in closer fellowship with God</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">How is that so?</span> <span>It is these storms that remind us that God is the only answer to our situations.</span> <b>1Pe 1:7  That the trial of your faith, being much more precious than of gold that perisheth, though it be tried with fire, might be found unto praise and honour and glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ: </b> </li></ul></ul><h2>2) There is Peace in the Storm</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">1) Peace comes First Through Coming to Christ</span> <span></span> <b>Mat 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">2) Peace comes from Walking With Christ</span> <span></span> <b>Mat 11:29  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. </b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">How to walk with Christ:</span> <span></span> <b>1) Through Prayer </b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight"></span> <span></span> <b>2) Through Reading Your Bible</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight"></span> <span></span> <b>3) Through going to Church</b> </li></ul></ul><h2>Will you find Your Peace In Christ This Morning?</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">God says Cast All Your Care Upon Him</span> <span></span> <b>Will you trust Christ this morning with your burdens</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Are you saved</span> <span></span> <b>Dont leave here this morning without knowing Christ as your saviour</b> </li></ul></body></html>
