        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Going a little further:</span>  (If you would have told me...purposed in my heart)<b>Eph 2:10  For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus unto good works, which God hath before ordained <span class="sub_highlight">that we should walk in them.</span></b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">The question I want to ask you, Where are you in your walk with Christ.</span>  (Can you go a little further?) </li>

        <ul>
        <h2>How do we go even further? (already stretched thin) </h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Answer God's call on our life</span> (drove into the parking lot)<b>Php 3:14  I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Get more active in serving</span> (I know you serve but Compare your sacrifices to God's) <b>1Pe 4:10  As every man hath received the gift, even so minister the same one to another, as good stewards of the manifold grace of God. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The blessings of going further</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">You are going to see God's footsteps in your path</span>(Go a little further long enough...) (dragging your cross if you have too)<b>Luk 9:23  And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You will see lives changed</span> (Imagine the joy Andrew must have felt leading Peter to the Lord) <b>Joh 1:40  One of the two which heard John speak, and followed him, was Andrew, Simon Peter's brother. 
Joh 1:41  He first findeth his own brother Simon, and saith unto him, We have found the Messias, which is, being interpreted, the Christ. </b></li>
        </ul>

        <ul>
        <h2>Where's the need: </h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">There's a need in God's ministries</span> (If youre not serving in one of God's ministries here, we need your help) <b>1Co 12:14  For the body is not one member, but many. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">There's a need in your prayers </span> (Don't discount the power of prayer) <b>Jer 33:3  Call unto me, and I will answer thee, and shew thee great and mighty things, which thou knowest not. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>Closing:</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Have you gone as far as you are willing to go for God? (will you tell God He put too much on your plate)</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Is there something in your life God is asking for, (maybe your time, prayers or giving) </span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Will you go a little further for God? </span></li>
