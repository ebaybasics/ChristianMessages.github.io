            <h2>Discerning Truth From Lies</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">Last Week - Recap</span> We talked about Jesus being the way out <b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Many ways, and many truths</span> The world is confused, The believe in many ways and truths. <b></b></li><li><span class="highlight">Standard of Truth</span> If we are going to decide what is Truth, we need a measuring stick <b>Joh 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. </b></li></ul><h2>Importance of the Truth</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">The World is a Battlefield</span> Once saved, we join ranks with God. He is our commander, and we are His soldiers <b>2Ti 2:4  No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Truth - How to Survive</span> This truth gives us all we need to survive the battle <b>Psa 18:30  As for God, his way is perfect: the word of the LORD is tried: he is a buckler (*a shield) to all those that trust in him. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Truth is How to Attack</span> If we are to be good soldiers, we need to know how to use our weapon - The Bible is our Sword <b>Heb 4:12  For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Truth tells us the Purpose of the Battle</span> Why have we been under attack, why does the devil hate us, we exist in the middle of a war and the Bible explains why <b>Eph 6:12  For we wrestle not against flesh and blood, but against principalities, against powers, against the rulers of the darkness of this world, against spiritual wickedness in high places. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Truth tells us the Victors</span> If your saved today, youre on the winning side. One day, every knee will bow to God <b>Isa 45:22-23  Look unto me, and be ye saved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none else. I have sworn by myself, the word is gone out of my mouth in righteousness, and shall not return, That unto me every knee shall bow, every tongue shall swear. </b></li></ul><h2>Lies of the World</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">We Can Live as We Choose</span> One of the biggest lies is that we can do as we please, it doesnt matter  <b>1Jn 1:6-7  If we say that we have fellowship with him, and walk in darkness, we lie, and do not the truth: But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">There's no difference between right and wrong</span> The world rejects God because they want to live in sin, so they deny the existence of sin <b>1Jn 1:8  If we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Christian Liberties</span> So-called Christians will take the Bible out of context and say they have liberty to sin -  <b>Gal 5:13  For, brethren, ye have been called unto liberty; only use not liberty for an occasion to the flesh, but by love serve one another. </b></li></ul><h2>What is the Truth</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">Definition</span> Websters 1828 <b>Conformity to fact or reality; exact accordance with that which is, or has been, or shall be. The truth of history constitutes its whole value. We rely on the truth of the scriptural prophecies</b></li><li><span class="highlight">His Word is Truth</span> Jesus's prayer right before He was arrested - Asking His father to set apart and make Holy those that Believe on Jesus <b>Joh 17:17  Sanctify them through thy truth: thy word is truth. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Truth is Sincerity</span> (Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman, The Lord is seeking sincere worshippers)   <b>Joh 4:23  But the hour cometh, and now is, when the true (*sincere) worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and in truth (*with sincerity): for the Father seeketh such to worship him. </b></li></ul><h2>Breaking Free</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">Believing on Jesus</span> Jesus Miracle of Him about to heal a boy with a evil spirit - his father is explaining the destructiveness of the spirit (like addiction) and Jesus says they must believe <b>Mar 9:22-23  And ofttimes it hath cast him into the fire, and into the waters, to destroy him: but if thou canst do any thing, have compassion on us, and help us.  Jesus said unto him, If thou canst believe, all things are possible to him that believeth. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Continue in His Word</span> Everything you hear from an appointed teacher is not by man, its by God. You must continue in His teaching to break free <b>2Ti 3:14  But continue thou in the things which thou hast learned and hast been assured of, knowing of whom thou hast learned them; </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Be His Disciple</span> (you want to live as a free man, you must follow Him, evidence of this will be that you put others first) <b>Mat 16:24-25  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</b></li><li><span class="highlight">Learn of Jesus </span> Our goal is to be more like Him, and less like us <b>2Pe 3:18  But grow in grace, and in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ. To him be glory both now and for ever. Amen. </b></li></ul><h2>Remaining Free - Our Text John 8:31-32</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">Increase Our Faith</span> The faith that Peter had when he walked on water was not the same faith he had when he first confessed that the Lord was the messiah <b>“  Then said Jesus to those Jews which believed on him”</b></li><li><span class="highlight">Obedience</span> We must apply God's word to our life, it is not enough that we hear and believe but we must do <b>“…If ye continue (*implying there is an action involved) in my word”</b></li><li><span class="highlight">Know the Truth</span> To remain free, we must continue to know Him and understand Him by reading the Word daily.  <b>“And ye shall know the truth (*You know it by reading it daily),”</b></li><li><span class="highlight">Live Free</span> Some people our unshackled and the prison gate opens yet they remain right where there at <b> “and the truth shall make you free. (*But you must continue to live free - God will not force you to be free) “</b></li></ul><h2>Closing</h2><ul><li><span class="highlight">Christian</span> Are you struggling with getting victory over sin?   Confess it to Him and follow His Truth  <b>1Jn 1:9  If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. </b></li><li><span class="highlight">Christian</span> Are you following after God like you were called to – Look to Jesus, His footsteps are worth following in <b></b></li><li><span class="highlight">Lost</span> If you don’t know Jesus, and don’t have the freedom He promises don’t let another moment go by, come and let us take a Bible and show you how you can be Free  <b>Joh 8:36  If the Son therefore shall make you free, ye shall be free indeed. </b></li></ul></body></html>
