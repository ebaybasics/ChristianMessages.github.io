          <li>It has really been a burden on my heart that more people should get involved in the ministries at Gospel Light Baptist Church. </li>
          <li>I want to focus in the phrase "of the high calling of God" Tonight. Ive titled this message answering the call. Do you know that God has a call for you life. How do I know that, because I am holding the script. The Bible says that there is a high calling of God. Paul could have wrote, I press toward my high calling but he didnt. Why, because the Holy Spirit wanted us to know that this high calling didnt belong to Paul alone, it was of the high calling, that meant that it doesnt matter who you are God has a calling for your life. Will you answer it?</li>
