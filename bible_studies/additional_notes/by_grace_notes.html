          <li>Intro:</li>
          <ul>
              <li></li>
              <li> God's plan of Salvation is the same for everyone: Act 10:35 "But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him." </li>
              <li> Nobody earns or deserves Salvation (I am glad for that): Eph 2:8-9b "...it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Why did God sacrifice Himself for us?: -Our Text: "For by grace..."</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Grace is defined as the free, unmerited love and favor of God </li>
              <li>Number 1 He is God and He chose to: Rom 11:36"  For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. "</li>
              <li>He did it because He loves us: John 3:16"  For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. "</li>

          </ul>
          <li>The Blessings of Salvation: -Our Text: "...it is the gift of God:..."</li>
          <ul>
              <li>You will start getting victories over things holding you down: Rom 6:14  "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."  </li>
              <li>You will know peace in your life: Isaiah 26:3 "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee." </li>
              <li>Your past will no longer haunt you: Psalm 103:12 "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The Requirements of Salvation:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>You must believe that God is who He says He is: Eph 2:8 "For by grace are ye saved through faith;..."</li>
              <li>Our sin separates us from God, and a price has to be paid - something has to give: Rom 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death..."</li>
              <li>We have a choice, we pay for our debt or accept God's sacrifice/gift for us: Rom 6:23b "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</li>
          </ul>
          <li>What are you going to do with it?:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Will you accept the peace and blessings that can only come through His salvation? John 3:36 "He that believeth on the Son hat everlasting life:..."</li>
              <li>Will you reject God and His gift? - You will answer for that Joh 12:48 "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. "</li>
              <li>You might not get another chance: Jas 4:14 "Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. "</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Will you accept His gift?:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>If you've never experienced the blessings of God NOW is the time</li>
              <li>Have you fallen away from God? Dont leave here today without seeking His face. God is quick to forgive</li>
