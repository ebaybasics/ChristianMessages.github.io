        <li>Intro: Hard to trust anymore</li>
        <li>Who God claims to be</li>
        <ul>
            <li>He claims to be creator of all <b>Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. </b></li>
            <li>He claims to be able to give us a new life <b>2Co 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. </b></li>
            <li>He claims to be the provider of peace and rest <b>Mat 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </b></li>
            <li>He claims to be the only way <b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <li>Evidences for Him:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Personal testimony</li>
            <li>The cohesiveness of the Bible (so many different authors all writing about the same God) (imagine a book series was written 500 years ago in America. Would the main character behave the same 200 years ago as he would in todays version?)<b>2Ti 3:16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: </b></li>
            <li>Prophecies that have come true (Isaiah written 800 years before Jesus)<b>Isa 7:14  Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <li>God asks us to prove Him: <b>Mal 3:10  Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. </b></li>
        <ul>
            <li>The reward of believing that He is who He says He is</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Eternal life: <b>Joh 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. </b></li>
                <li>The creator of the universe will be on your side: <b>Rom 8:31  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? </b></li>
                <li>You will have reinforcements: <b>Gal 6:2  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. </b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>The consequence for not believing Him</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Eternally separated from God: <b>Rom 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </b></li>
                <li>The truth will be your judge: <b>Joh 12:48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </b></li>
                <li>God designed it so none would have the excuse that they didnt know: <b>Rom_1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</b></li>
            </ul>
            <li>Weighing to risk\reward results</li>
        </ul>

        <li>Salvation message</li>
        <ul>
            <li>It takes believing He is who He says He is and knowing He is the only way <b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li>
            <li>Knowing it is us who separated ourselves from God through sin <b>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </b></li>
            <li>God loved us in the thick of our sin, and He built the bridge for our relationship to be repaired <b>Rom 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. </b></li>
            <li>That we should turn from our way to His<b> Mat 4:17  “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. “</b></li>
            <li>And accept Him into our hearts as our Lord and Saviour <b>Rom 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. </b></li>
