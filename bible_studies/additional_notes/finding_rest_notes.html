    <h1> Title:</h1>
    <h3> Mat 11:28-30   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </h3>

          <ul>
              <li></li>
          </ul>
          <li>Who is this rest for?</li>
            <ul>
                <li>The Sinners: (I am a sinner saved by Grace) Mat 9:13  But go ye and learn what that meaneth, I will have mercy, and not sacrifice: for I am not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance.  </li>
                <li>Those that thirst for God: (God sized hole with other things) Joh 7:37  In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink.  </li>
                <li>The exhausted: Mat 11:28a "Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden..."</li>
            </ul>
          <li>The benefits of rest in Christ:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>You will be renewed: 2Co 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. </li>
              <li>You will have reinforcements: </li>
              <ul>
                  <li>1Co 12:14  For the body is not one member, but many. </li>
                  <li>Gal 6:2  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. </li>
              </ul>
              <li>You will have refuge: </li>
              <ul>
                  <li>Psalm 46:1 - "God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble."</li>
                  <li>Rom 8:31  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? </li>
              </ul>
          </ul>
          <li>How to come to Christ:</li>
          <ul>
              <li>You must do it His way: Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </li>
              <li>You must be born again: Joh 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </li>
              <ul>
                  <li>How?</li>
                  <ul>
                      <li>You must know what keeps us separated from God: Rom 6:23a   For the wages of sin is death; </li>
                      <li>In order to repair our fellowship with God, He gave His life for ours: Rom 6:23b but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </li>
                      <li>Turn from our way to His: Mat 4:17  “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. “</li>
                      <li>To receive God's promised rest, we must accept God's gift: Rom 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. </li>
                  </ul>
              </ul>
              <li>You must continue to follow after God: Luk 9:23  And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me. </li>
          </ul>
          <li>You say you're tired, but are you tired enough?</li>
          <ul>
              <li>Will you accept God's rest in your life?: (our text) Mat 11:29  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. </li>
              <li>Will you reject Him?: (Theres a consequence for that) Joh 12:48 "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. "</li>
              <li>This might be your last chance: Jas 4:14 "Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. "</li>
          </ul>
          <li>Have you been looking for your way out, THIS is it. Will you accept God's rest? </li>
          <li>Have you drifted away from God, come back to Him this morning. </li>
