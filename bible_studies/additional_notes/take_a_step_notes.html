  <h1> Take A Step:</h1>
  <h2>James 4:8-10 "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."</h2>

        <li>Intro: Question your motives for being here. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Did you come to use the house of God for your benefit? (I did too) God knows: Isa 55:8  For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD. </li>
            <li>Maybe you dont know why you came: Php 2:13  For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of his good pleasure.  </li>
            <li>If you came because you wanted to hear from God, you took a step toward Him. God is not a liar, He draws closer to you. What are you going to do about it? Psa 145:18  The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him, to all that call upon him in truth. </li>
          </ul>
        <li> The promise for approaching God </li>
          <ul>
            <li>You will be lifted up: Jas 4:10  Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up. , Mat 6:33  But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things shall be added unto you.</li>
            <li>God is on your team. Rom 8:31  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us?  </li>
            <li>You will never again be forsaken: Deuteronomy 31:6 6 Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake thee. </li>
          </ul>
        <li> How to approach God, and make it last: you must be saved</li>
          <ul>
            <li>What's keeping you separated from God? Rom 6:16  Know ye not, that to whom ye yield yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of sin unto death, or of obedience unto righteousness? </li>
            <li>The Bible calls this separation death - we are dead to God by our own choosing, God doesnt want this: Rom 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </li>
            <li>Turn from your way to His: Act 3:19  Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord; </li>
            <li> The answer is through Jesus Christ, will you accept it? Rom 10:13  For whosoever shall call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved. </li>
            <li> The everlasting promise: Joh 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. </li>
          </ul>

        <li> What's next: 1Sa 2:8  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. </li>
          <ul>
            <li>Its time to start putting away old things, once you accept God's salvation for you you are a new creation: 2Corinthians 5:17 Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. </li>
            <li>You are set among princes: You are a apart of the family of God. As a part of this family, you need to be active in His house: Heb 10:25  Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is; but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching. </li>
            <li> Along with God, you have a team of people to fight alongside of you. But you are only as good as your training. You must get involved in your training: Pro 27:17  Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the countenance of his friend.  </li>

        <li>God took the first step when He loved us, gave His life on the cross for us.</li>
        <li>Question your motives for being here. If you came because you wanted to hear from God, you took a step toward Him. God is not a liar, He draws closer to you. What are you going to do about it?</li>
        <li>"Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up.", If we do this He will lift us up, we will be royalty: 1 Sam 2:8 "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the Lord's, and he hath set the world upon them." </li>

    <li>Free writing thoughts:</li>
      <ul>
        <li>Why are you here this morning. Only you know. Maybe you got in the car with me thinking the breakfast sounded good. Maybe you werent sure why you got in the car with me. Maybe, you came because you are tired of the way things are. You know what you get out there, more of the same. In here, theres a chance you may receive something new. Something you never experienced before. Your only going to be here for a little while, so whats the risk in giving all of your attention to find out if God has something for you today. This world woul dhave you believe your life is over, but God chose you when He put Himself on that cross for you. You think He didnt know you before you were you? God knew, and if it was just you, He would have died for just You. That is His step toward you. He wants a relationship with you, and that means you are going to have to take a step toward Him. I got good news for you, His steps are always bigger than ours. If youre here this morning, and your motives are right, then you have taken that step toward Him, and God is drawing nigh to you. </li>
