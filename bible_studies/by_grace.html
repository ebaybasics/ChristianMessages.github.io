    <h1> By Grace</h1>
    <h3><span class="highlight">Why are you here?</span> Pure motives lead to life-changing decisions being made Isaiah 55:12a "For ye shall go out with joy, and be led forth with peace:"</h3>
    <h3> Eph 2:8-9 "For by grace are ye saved through faith; and that not of yourselves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</h3>
    <ul>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">What is Grace?</span><b>Websters 1828 defines Grace as the free, unmerited love and favor of God.</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">God's plan of Salvation is the same for everyone:</span>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li>
                    <li><b>Act 10:35 "But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him."</b></li>
                </ul> </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Nobody earns or deserves Salvation:</span> (I am glad for that) <b>Eph 2:8-9b "...it is the gift of God: Not of works, lest any man should boast."</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Why did God sacrifice Himself for us?: -Our Text: "For by grace..."</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Number 1 He is God and He chose to:</span><b>Rom 11:36 "For of him, and through him, and to him, are all things: to whom be glory for ever. Amen. "</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">He did it because He loves us:</span><b>John 3:16 "For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life. "</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>The Blessings of Salvation: -Our Text: "...it is the gift of God:..."</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">You will start getting victories over things holding you down:</span><b>Rom 6:14  "For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace."</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You will know peace in your life:</span><b>Isaiah 26:3 "Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee: because he trusteth in thee."</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Your past will no longer haunt you:</span><b>Psalm 103:12 "As far as the east is from the west, so far hath he removed our transgressions from us.</b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The Requirements of Salvation:</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">You must believe that God is who He says He is:</span><b>Eph 2:8 "For by grace are ye saved through faith;..."</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Our sin separates us from God, and a price has to be paid:</span> something has to give <b>Rom 6:23 "For the wages of sin is death..."</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">We have a choice, we pay for our debt or accept God's sacrifice/gift for us:</span> (short of money at the register) (being in the courtroom multiple life sentences)<b>Rom 6:23b "...but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord."</b></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What are you going to do with it?:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Will you accept the peace and blessings that can only come through His salvation?</span><b>John 3:36 "He that believeth on the Son hath everlasting life:..."</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Will you reject God and His gift?</span><b>Joh 12:48 "He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. "</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You might not get another chance:</span><b>Jas 4:14 "Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. "</li></b></li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Will you accept His gift?:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">If you've never experienced the blessings of God NOW is the time</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Have you fallen away from God? Dont leave here today without seeking His face. God is quick to forgive</span></li>
