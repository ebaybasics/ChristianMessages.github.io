                    <h3>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God.  Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made.  Joh 1:4  In him was life; and the life was the light of men. </h3>
            <h2>Leave Your Troubles at the Trouble Tree: </h2><ul></ul><h2>There was a carpenter hired to restore an old farmhouse and just finished up a rough first day on the job. A flat tire had made him lose an hour of work, his electric saw quit, and now his ancient pickup refused to start. As his employer drove him home, he sat in stony silence. On arriving, he invited his boss in to meet his family. As they walked toward the front door, he paused briefly at a small tree, touching the tips of the branches with both hands. Then, opening the door, he underwent an amazing transformation. His tanned face was wreathed in smiles, and he hugged his two small children and gave his wife a kiss. Afterwards as the man and his boss walked to the car, they passed the tree. The boss asked him about what he had seen him do earlier. "Oh, that is my ’trouble tree,’" he replied. "I know I cannot help having troubles on the job, but one thing is for sure-troubles do not belong in the house with my wife and the children. So I just hang ’em on the tree every night when I come home; then in the morning, I pick them up again. "Funny thing is," he said smilingly, "when I come out in the morning to pick them up, there are not as many as I remember hanging up the night before."</h2><ul></ul><h2>Introduction</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Name of Jesus is Well Spoken of In the US</span> <span></span> <b>No doubt, everyone in this room has heard the name and heard things how JESUS:</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Heals, Performs Miracles, Forgives us Our Sins etc</span> <span></span> <b></b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">We Know the Resume of Jesus Well</span> <span></span> <b>If we are not Careful then we will mistake knowing His resume for having a RELATIONSHIP with Him</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">In fact Jesus Warns of This in Matthew</span> <span></span> <b>Mat 7:22  Many will say to me in that day, Lord, Lord, have we not prophesied in thy name? and in thy name have cast out devils? and in thy name done many wonderful works?  Mat 7:23  And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you: depart from me, ye that work iniquity. </b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Problem: Many confuse knowing of Jesus with Knowing Jesus Personally</span> <span>This causes many to think of Jesus as a genie who you can call on as you need something</span> <b>This leads to:</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Disappointing Results</span> <span></span> <b>What Happens When You Call On Jesus and Get Unanswered Prayers</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">----> Your Saying God wont Answer MY Prayers??!?</span> <span></span> <b>Psa 66:18  If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me: </b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Solution: Consider This New Year to Developing a Knowing Christ Relationship</span> <span>HOW: We go to HIS WORD</span> <b>Joh 20:31  But these are written, that ye might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God; and that believing ye might have life through his name. </b> </li></ul><h2>This morning let us Know Jesus through His Relationship with God:</h2><ul></ul><h2>Joh 1:1  In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.  Joh 1:2  The same was in the beginning with God. </h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Eternal Word (John 1:1) </span> <span>Jesus and God are One, Co-existent and coequal. </span> <b>Rev 19:13  And he was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood: and his name is called The Word of God. </b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Manifestation of God's Glory</span> <span> Jesus, as the Word, is the exact representation of God's being</span> <b>Heb 1:3  Who being the brightness of his glory, and the express image of his person, and upholding all things by the word of his power, when he had by himself purged our sins, sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high;</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Turn to Gen 1:2 And the earth was without form, and void; and darkness was upon the face of the deep.
