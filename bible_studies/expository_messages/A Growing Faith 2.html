                    <h3>James 1:2-3 (KJV)</h3>
                    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
            <h2>In This Life We Stumble</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Obvious Stumble of The Unsaved</span> <span>The Bible teaches us that without Christ we are absent of light. In fact we are so deprived of light that our own heart deceives us into believing we can see SENSORY DEPRIVATION</span> <b>Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it? </b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">The "Feel-Good" Lie</span> <span>This is why the world is constantly looking for "So-Called" Truths that feel good and tickle the ear</span> <b>2Ti 4:3  For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine; but after their own lusts shall they heap to themselves teachers, having itching ears;  2Ti 4:4  And they shall turn away their ears from the truth, and shall be turned unto fables. </b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">We have to be careful</span> <span></span> <b>When Coming to church, be open to what you need to hear, not what you want. There is only one truth that is right, that is His truth (Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. )</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The less Obvious Stumble of the Saved</span> <span></span> <b>We want to believe that when we are saved, all of our problems go away but this is contrary to the Word of God. In fact its likely that you will face even more adversity than before. This adversity is known as Spiritual Warfare.</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Stumbling Doesnt Come from Adversity but By Getting Your Eyes of Christ</span> <span>How Can You See if You Dont Have The Light of God illuminating YOUR PATH</span> <b>Psa 119:105  NUN. Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path. </b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Magnitude of The Stumble  ("fall")</span> <span></span> <b></b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">The Danger of The Soft Stumble</span> <span>Truth is when we fall it should be our prayer that we fall hard and have no worldly success. Without the HARD FALL, we dont see OUR NEED For Christ. This is what Jesus was teaching us when He said its easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle....</span> <b>Mat 19:23  Then said Jesus unto his disciples, Verily I say unto you, That a rich man shall hardly enter into the kingdom of heaven. ||**|| Mat 19:26  But Jesus beheld them, and said unto them, With men this is impossible; but with God all things are possible. </b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">The Severity of The Hard Fall</span> <span>Ive seen a lot of people sober up but had no foundation they were building their life on. What ends up happening is these people, not being rooted, go back to where they came from and end up worse then what the started.</span> <b>Turn To Matt 12:43-45 "Mat 12:43  When the unclean spirit is gone out of a man, he walketh through dry places, seeking rest, and findeth none.  Mat 12:44  Then he saith, I will return into my house from whence I came out; and when he is come, he findeth it empty, swept, and garnished.  Mat 12:45  Then goeth he, and taketh with himself seven other spirits more wicked than himself, and they enter in and dwell there: and the last state of that man is worse than the first. Even so shall it be also unto this wicked generation. "</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Lord's Promised Victory</span> <span></span> <b>TURN TO 1Samuel 2:8 "1Sa 2:8  He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he hath set the world upon them. "</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">You Must Hit Bottom</span> <span></span> <b>Notice in our text, "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust" There is no lower place than the dust</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">He Lifts You Up And Sets You Among Princes</span> <span></span> <b>God's intention is not to lift you up and leave you where you are.

And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  Mat 14:30  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  Mat 14:31  And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  Mat 14:32  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  Mat 14:33  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. "</h2><ul></ul><h2>Before Peter's Victory Over the Supernatural, He First Had to Be Solid on The Fundamentals of Christianity</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Obedience To Christ Was First</span> <span>Sometimes we put the cart before the horse. We know God is real, and we know He has a supernatural will for our lives but we want to get straight into our calling without having a solid foundation. The first step of every believer has to be obedience and followship of Jesus Christ</span> <b>Mat 14:22  And straightway JESUS CONSTRAINED his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Peter Was a Member of The Church</span> <span>The Church is the training ground of every Christian</span> <b>Mat 14:22  And straightway Jesus constrained HIS DISCIPLES to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away. </b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">There is a difference between a believer and a Christian</span> <span></span> <b>Act 11:26  And when he had found him, he brought him unto Antioch.
