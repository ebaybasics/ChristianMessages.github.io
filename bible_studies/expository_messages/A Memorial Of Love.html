                    <h3>Joh 15:9  As the Father hath loved me, so have I loved you: continue ye in my love.  Joh 15:10  If ye keep my commandments, ye shall abide in my love; even as I have kept my Father's commandments, and abide in his love.  Joh 15:11  These things have I spoken unto you, that my joy might remain in you, and that your joy might be full.  Joh 15:12  This is my commandment, That ye love one another, as I have loved you.  Joh 15:13  Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.  Joh 15:14  Ye are my friends, if ye do whatsoever I command you.  Joh 15:15  Henceforth I call you not servants; for the servant knoweth not what his lord doeth: but I have called you friends; for all things that I have heard of my Father I have made known unto you.  Joh 15:16  Ye have not chosen me, but I have chosen you, and ordained you, that ye should go and bring forth fruit, and that your fruit should remain: that whatsoever ye shall ask of the Father in my name, he may give it you.  Joh 15:17  These things I command you, that ye love one another. </h3>
