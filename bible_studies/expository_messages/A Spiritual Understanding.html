                    <h3>Col 1:9-17  For this cause we also, since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you, and to desire that ye might be filled with the knowledge of his will in all wisdom and spiritual understanding;  Col 1:10  That ye might walk worthy of the Lord unto all pleasing, being fruitful in every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God;  Col 1:11  Strengthened with all might, according to his glorious power, unto all patience and longsuffering with joyfulness;  Col 1:12  Giving thanks unto the Father, which hath made us meet to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in light:  Col 1:13  Who hath delivered us from the power of darkness, and hath translated us into the kingdom of his dear Son:  Col 1:14  In whom we have redemption through his blood, even the forgiveness of sins: Col 1:15  Who is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of every creature:  Col 1:16  For by him were all things created, that are in heaven, and that are in earth, visible and invisible, whether they be thrones, or dominions, or principalities, or powers: all things were created by him, and for him:  Col 1:17  And he is before all things, and by him all things consist. </h3>
