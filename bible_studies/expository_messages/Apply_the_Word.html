Or has sin ever gotten you so deep that it felt normal. His Word shines a light right onto the whole mess to show us who we really are. Its painful, I admit. But if the gangrene on your foot is going to spread to the whole body, isnt it better to cut it off to save your life! Dont let it continue to fester, let the light shine onto your reality. I got news for you, no matter your reality, we are all unrighteous.
