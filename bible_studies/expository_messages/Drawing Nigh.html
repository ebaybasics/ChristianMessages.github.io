He said, "If I quit these things, I think they cover about all. I will quit drinking, swearing, stop gambling, and I will quit being impure." Billy said, "Good.

I got into the cage and was pulled to the top." "How much did you pay to come out of the pit?" The miner looked at the preacher in astonishment. "Pay? Of course, I didn’t pay anything." "Well," said the preacher, "weren’t you afraid to trust yourself to that cage? Wasn’t it too cheap?" "Oh, no," he said; "it was cheap for me, but it cost the company a lot of money to sink that shaft." Then the implication of what he had said struck him, and he saw that though he could have salvation without money and without price, it had cost the infinite God a great price to rescue lost men.</b> </li></ul></ul><h2>The Reward of Coming To Christ</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">No Doubt You Stand On Your Own Two Feet</span> <span></span> <b>I look around this room, and I understand the struggles that youve faced.
