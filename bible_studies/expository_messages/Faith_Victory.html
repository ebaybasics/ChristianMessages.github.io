                    <h3>Mat 14:22  And straightway Jesus constrained his disciples to get into a ship, and to go before him unto the other side, while he sent the multitudes away.  Mat 14:23  And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain apart to pray: and when the evening was come, he was there alone.  Mat 14:24  But the ship was now in the midst of the sea, tossed with waves: for the wind was contrary.  Mat 14:25  And in the fourth watch of the night Jesus went unto them, walking on the sea.  Mat 14:26  And when the disciples saw him walking on the sea, they were troubled, saying, It is a spirit; and they cried out for fear.  Mat 14:27  But straightway Jesus spake unto them, saying, Be of good cheer; it is I; be not afraid.  Mat 14:28  And Peter answered him and said, Lord, if it be thou, bid me come unto thee on the water.  Mat 14:29  And he said, Come. And when Peter was come down out of the ship, he walked on the water, to go to Jesus.  Mat 14:30  But when he saw the wind boisterous, he was afraid; and beginning to sink, he cried, saying, Lord, save me.  Mat 14:31  And immediately Jesus stretched forth his hand, and caught him, and said unto him, O thou of little faith, wherefore didst thou doubt?  Mat 14:32  And when they were come into the ship, the wind ceased.  Mat 14:33  Then they that were in the ship came and worshipped him, saying, Of a truth thou art the Son of God. </h3>
