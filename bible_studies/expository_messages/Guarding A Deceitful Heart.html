                    <h1>Guarding A Deceitful Heart</h1>
                    <h3>Jer 17:7  Blessed is the man that trusteth in the LORD, and whose hope the LORD is.  Jer 17:8  For he shall be as a tree planted by the waters, and that spreadeth out her roots by the river, and shall not see when heat cometh, but her leaf shall be green; and shall not be careful in the year of drought, neither shall cease from yielding fruit.  Jer 17:9  The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?  Jer 17:10  I the LORD search the heart, I try the reins, even to give every man according to his ways, and according to the fruit of his doings. </h3>
