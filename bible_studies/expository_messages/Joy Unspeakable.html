                    <h1>Joy Unspeakable</h1>
                    <h3>Psa 23:1  A Psalm of David. The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.  Psa 23:2  He maketh me to lie down in green pastures: he leadeth me beside the still waters.  Psa 23:3  He restoreth my soul: he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name's sake.  Psa 23:4  Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff they comfort me.  Psa 23:5  Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies: thou anointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over.  Psa 23:6  Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life: and I will dwell in the house of the LORD for ever. </h3>
