                    <h1>Living Epistles</h1>
                    <h3>2Co 3:2  Ye are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read of all men:  2Co 3:3  Forasmuch as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of Christ ministered by us, written not with ink, but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tables of stone, but in fleshy tables of the heart. </h3>
            <h2>A group of atheists were criticizing the Bible. One of them spoke about creation. He said, "What man with any common sense could believe that several thousand years ago, God stooped down and picked up a piece of mud, breathed on it, and changed it into a human being?" A Christian man standing by overheard the conversation and responded by saying: "I cannot answer all the questions about creation, but this I know: One night God stooped down and picked up the dirtiest piece of mud in this city, breathed upon it by His Holy Spirit, and changed a gambling, thieving, drinking wretch into a peace-loving man of God. I was that man."</h2><ul></ul><h2>I Thanks God that He is in the Business of Transforming Lives</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">He is in the Business of: Turning Hearts of Stone into Hearts of Flesh</span> <span></span> <b>This world, and this flesh gives you some calluses and thick skin, but no matter how callused you are, deep down everyone of us longs to have life in our heart again.</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">God has what you are looking for:</span> <span></span> <b>Eze 36:26  A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you an heart of flesh. </b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">He is in the Business of: Converting Trials into Victories</span> <span>It's a tough time of the year to be without housing, without family, without hope.

He was telling me a story of how his newborn baby was in the hospital. The hospital was trying to prepare him for the worst case scenario. David went to his knees in prayer, and told God that the baby belonged to God. If it was God's will then he would be at peace with that. God's will was that baby would live and is happy and healthy today. This is an illustration of the peace God wants to give to you but can only come from fully trusting Him</span> <b>Philippians 4:7, "And the peace of God, which passeth all understanding, shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus."</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Becoming a Living Epistle Through God’s Indwelling</span> <span></span> <b></b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">An Epistle Is: </span> <span></span> <b>A letter written to others.
