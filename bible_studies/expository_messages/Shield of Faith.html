    <h1>The Shield Of Faith</h1>
    <h3>Dan 3:1 Nebuchadnezzar the king made an image of gold, whose height was threescore cubits, and the breadth thereof six cubits: he set it up in the plain of Dura, in the province of Babylon. Dan 3:2 Then Nebuchadnezzar the king sent to gather together the princes, the governors, and the captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, to come to the dedication of the image which Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up. Dan 3:3 Then the princes, the governors, and captains, the judges, the treasurers, the counsellors, the sheriffs, and all the rulers of the provinces, were gathered together unto the dedication of the image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up; and they stood before the image that Nebuchadnezzar had set up. Dan 3:4 Then an herald cried aloud, To you it is commanded, O people, nations, and languages, Dan 3:5 That at what time ye hear the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, dulcimer, and all kinds of musick, ye fall down and worship the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king hath set up: Dan 3:6 And whoso falleth not down and worshippeth shall the same hour be cast into the midst of a burning fiery furnace. Dan 3:7 Therefore at that time, when all the people heard the sound of the cornet, flute, harp, sackbut, psaltery, and all kinds of musick, all the people, the nations, and the languages, fell down and worshipped the golden image that Nebuchadnezzar the king had set up.</h3>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Who is King Nebuchadnezzar?</span> <span><b>A powerful and strategic military King with great ambition. His reign was about 600 years before Christ and we know him mostly for his conquering of the Jewish people.</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Nebuchadnezzar was worldly, but not without Conscious</span> <span><b>After conquering the Jewish people he chose to keep a remnant, the Bible describes as children who were skillful and teachable and train them in the way of the Chaldeans.</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Inside this remnant was Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego</span> <span><b>Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego illustrate to us the duplicity nature of the Christian, How to Love and Serve God while following the Authority and Ordinances of a Pagan King</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Where To Draw the Line</span> <span>I’d like to note that Shadrach Meshach and Abednego lived in conquered times. In a time where they were quite literally delivered into the hands of their enemies,</span> <b>Dan 1:2 And the Lord gave Jehoiakim king of Judah into his hand, with part of the vessels of the house of God: which he carried into the land of Shinar to the house of his god; and he brought the vessels into the treasure house of his god.</b></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Their Faith was unwavering.</span> <span><b>In fact, they managed to make the best out of a bad situation and were found in our texts to be in a position of comfort and leadership under the King.</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Justifiable Temptations</span> <span><b>The world by and large would probably not blame them for worshipping the statue that Nebuchadnezzar placed.</b></span>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">They Could Bow In Action But Not In Their Heart</span></li>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">God Didnt Care Anyway</span> <span><b>ILLUSTRATION:  How we justify our life being a platform to be ungodly. For instance, if someone hurts me, then it is okay for me to be disloyal to them</b></span></li>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">God Would Forgive Them For Sin</span> <span><b>This premeditated sin is hardening your neck to God</b> Pro 29:1 He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.</span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Despite Justifiable Temptations They Stood Their Ground</span> <span><b>These boys had purposed in their hearts to serve God, and when the fiery darts of temptation came they Lived by Faith</b></span> Heb 10:38 Now the just shall live by faith: but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What Is Faith</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Definition of Faith</span> <span><b>Heb 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Substance of things hoped for</span> <span><b>The word sub points us to consider the foundation of something. Foundation of all of our hope</b></span></li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">The Evidence of Things Not Seen</span> <span><b>When you have been praying for victory and God delivers this is the evidence of God. The world will call this coincidence but we must be careful not to fall into this worldly trap. This blessing of God is designed to increase our

 Faith</b></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>What Faith Looks Like</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith is a firm foundation:</span> <span><b>Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego displayed their durable devotion to God, daring to face death with a daring belief that God could deliver them, and if He didn't, they still wouldn't defy Him</b></span> Dan 3:16 Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, answered and said to the king, O Nebuchadnezzar, we are not careful to answer thee in this matter. Dan 3:17 If it be so, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and he will deliver us out of thine hand, O king.</li>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">"We Are Not Careful To Answer Thee"</span> <span><b>This was a non-negotiable for them. There was nothing to consider</b></span></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">"God Can Save us, but even if not We will not change our course"</span> <span><b>Gods ways are higher than ours, these boys understood that no matter what happened it was for the honor and Glory of God and they would not even in their final moments choose to betray God</b></span> Dan 3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</li>
        </ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith forms our actions:</span> <span><b>These three men didn't just profess faith, they lived it out by refusing to bow to the golden image, despite the king's decree</b></span> Dan 3:12 There are certain Jews whom thou hast set over the affairs of the province of Babylon, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego; these men, O king, have not regarded thee: they serve not thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith is the footprint of our loyalty to God:</span> <span><b>Their refusal to worship any other god was a testament to their deep-rooted loyalty and commitment to God. They purposed in their hearts to love God in the peaks and the valleys. This is what Faith looks like</b></span></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Eph 6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <h2>How Faith Is A Shield</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Fortifies Us</span> <span><b>These boys did something by all accounts look astoundingly brave. I don't know this but I imagine for them it wasn't a challenge at all. Their Faith was their Shield and fortified their position, and what we see as bravery was sourced from God Himself.</b></span> Psalm 28:7: "The LORD is my strength and my shield; my heart trusted in him, and I am helped: therefore my heart greatly rejoiceth; and with my song will I praise him."</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Fights Fear</span> <span><b>I know how hard it is. In our moments of trials and tribulations we get common fears don't we.</b></span>
            <ul>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Fear of "There Is No Point Anyway"</span> <span><b>What's the point, I do this and there is still so many steps left. Imagine if the boys said, what's the point anyway!</b></span></li>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Fear of "I'm always an outsider"</span> <span><b>Being a newcomer in a church can do this to us. Often times we lived lives so differently than what is preached from the pulpit. It's easy to feel alone and isolated like an outsider. Remember that's exactly who Christ came for</b></span></li>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Fear of "What If I am on the wrong side"</span> <span><b>If I die, and I am wrong then whatever. But if I die and I am right, I spend eternity with God in heaven. I'll take my chances</b></span></li>
                <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">As relatable as these fears may be they are not of God</span> <span><b>"For God hath not given us the spirit of fear; but of power, and of love, and of a sound mind." (2 Timothy 1:7, KJV)</b></span></li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Forms Resilience</span> <span><b>Temptation was large for Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Their Faith was bigger though, and because of that, they could say "Not Today Satan!"</b></span> Dan 3:18 But if not, be it known unto thee, O king, that we will not serve thy gods, nor worship the golden image which thou hast set up.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>How The Shield of Faith Protects</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <h2>Eph 6:16 Above all, taking the shield of faith, wherewith ye shall be able to quench all the fiery darts of the wicked.</h2>
    <ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Protects Our Whole Selves</span> <span><b>Up until now, we have looked at armor that aimed to protect an individual body part. When we are talking about the shield of faith, we are talking about a Spartan-sized shield. This shield would be used to cover the whole body.</b></span> Ancient Roman Soldiers were well trained on the battlefield, and they understood the importance of their shields. Their shields protected themselves, as well as their brothers next to them. They would use their shields often times in a testudo formation. In the testudo formation, the men would align their shields to form a packed formation covered with shields on the front and top. The first row of men, possibly excluding the men on the flanks, would hold their shields from about the height of their shins to their eyes, so as to cover the formation's front. The shields would be held in such a way that they presented a shield wall to all sides. The men in the back ranks would place their shields over their heads to protect the formation from above, balancing the shields on their helmets, overlapping them. If necessary, the legionaries on the sides and rear of the formation could stand sideways or backward with shields held as the front rows, so as to protect the formation's sides and rear; this reduced the speed and mobility of the formation, but offered consistent defensive strength against opposing infantry and excellent protection against arrows and other missile attacks.</li>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Protects from The Fiery Darts of The Wicked</span> <span><b>Satan and the wickedness of this world will use many arrows against us. The Bible teaches that we are under attack, but our Faith can withstand ALL of the darts.</b></span> Examples of Fiery Darts:</li>
        <ul>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Satan Will Tempt You</span> <span><b>The devil will entice you with things that you can justify. Drinking, using drugs, all these things can be justified when spun in the right light. Please let me convince you that this is old news, it's already been predicted in the Bible and the solution has been prescribed. Faith is the Victory</b></span></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Different Philosophies and "So-called Truths" Come</span> <span><b>An example of a fiery dart is when you find yourself examining your faith and belief system.</b></span></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Satan Will Say Your Efforts are Meaningless</span> <span><b>Paul spoke of this in Gal 6:9 And let us not be weary in well-doing: for in due season we shall reap if we faint not.</b></span></li>
            <li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Satan says You Are Alone</span> <span><b>Heb 13:5 Let your conversation be without covetousness; and be content with such things as ye have: for he hath said, I will never leave thee, nor forsake thee.</b></span></li>
        </ul>
        <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith Brings Divine Protection</span> <span><b>When You have done everything you can to stand, That is when the Power of God is revealed</b></span></li>

    <h2>When God Steps In: After the boys refused to bow to the idol of Nebuchadnezaar the king was furious.</h2>
    <ul></ul>
    <h2>Dan 3:19 Then was Nebuchadnezzar full of fury, and the form of his visage was changed against Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego: therefore he spake, and commanded that they should heat the furnace one seven times more than it was wont to be heated. Dan 3:20 And he commanded the most mighty men that were in his army to bind Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, and to cast them into the burning fiery furnace. Dan 3:21 Then these men were bound in their coats, their hosen, and their hats, and their other garments, and were cast into the midst of the burning fiery furnace. Dan 3:22 Therefore because the king's commandment was urgent, and the furnace exceeding hot, the flame of the fire slew those men that took up Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Dan 3:23 And these three men, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, fell down bound into the midst of the burning fiery furnace.</h2>

They answered and said unto the king, True, O king. Dan 3:25 He answered and said, Lo, I see four men loose, walking in the midst of the fire, and they have no hurt; and the form of the fourth is like the Son of God.</b></span></li>
