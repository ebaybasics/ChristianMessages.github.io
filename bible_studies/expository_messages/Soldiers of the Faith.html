    <h1>Soldiers of the Faith</h1>
    <h3>2 Timothy 2:1-4 "Thou therefore, my son, be strong in the grace that is in Christ Jesus. And the things that thou hast heard of me among many witnesses, the same commit thou to faithful men, who shall be able to teach others also. Thou therefore endure hardness, as a good soldier of Jesus Christ. No man that warreth entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier."</h3>

            <span class="highlight">Last week:</span>
            <span>We talked about the difference between being born again and being a Christian - Not all saved people can call themselves Christians</span>
            <b>Mat 16:24-25 Then said Jesus unto his disciples, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross, and follow me. For whosoever will save his life shall lose it: and whosoever will lose his life for my sake shall find it.</b>

            <span>Those that choose to be Christians are God's chosen soldiers</span>

                <span>We all have different personalities and different talents. In the battle, we need to remember we have the same goal</span>

                <span>You're never going to make it to the finish line if you don't believe in what you're fighting for. A good soldier that can endure hardness will believe in what he is fighting for</span>

            <span>PUTTING OUT A FIRE WITH BARE HANDS</span>
            <b>Flight Sergeant John Hannah was working as an air gunner in a bombing plane that was carrying out raids on German invasion barges. After they released their bombs, they came under heavy fire and took many direct hits. A fire broke out in the hull where he was working, and while other members of the aircraft bailed out around him, he worked for 10 minutes in the blaze to extinguish it. After heâ€™d tried everything, he used his hands, which resulted in severe burns to his eyes and face. For his bravery, Hannah was awarded the Victorian Cross, at just 18 years of age.</b>

            <span>When you are saved out of the fire, you get a target on your back. You ever notice how when your life is starting to come together, that's when the devil shows up.</span>

            <span>Grab a hold of the promises of God. God gives us a model of how to do this in Malachi</span>
            <b>Mal 3:10 Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it.</b>

            <span>Every week I ask that you stand when singing in the sanctuary. Usually, everyone will listen to the first song, then the second song 1 person will sit.

            <span>A lot of people profess to be saved, almost just as many can quote you some verses, but is Christ in your heart? If you've never felt compelled to follow after Christ of your own desire, you should question your own salvation. Why? Because it is the single most important decision you will ever make. Can you go to a time in your mind when you called out on Jesus, confessed you were a sinner that needed saving, and believed He was the only one capable of doing it? When you are reborn, you are battleborn</span>
