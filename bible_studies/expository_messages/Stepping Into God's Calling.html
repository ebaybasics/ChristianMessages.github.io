                    <h1>Stepping Into God's Calling</h1>
                    <h3>Philippians 3:14 “I press toward the mark for the prize of the high calling of God in Christ Jesus.”</h3>
            <h2>Intro</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Paul Understood Adversity</span> <span>He wrote the epistle to the church of Phillipi while in prison for preaching the Gospel</span> <b>Paul believed so much in his calling that he would be beat, imprisoned and eventually murdered for telling people about it</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">He wrote this epistle to a specific group</span> <span>When trying to understand what Paul is trying to communicate, we must understand that his audience was not just anybody.</span> <b></b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">His audience were people that were born again</span> <span></span> <b>Paul and Timotheus, the servants of Jesus Christ, to all the saints in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi, with the bishops and deacons:</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">What Paul Wants Us To Understand</span> <span></span> <b>Is that We all have a calling from God. But in order to understand it, we must be in position to receive it</b> </li></ul><h2>#1 To Receive God's Calling Their Must Be a Willingness --> Php 3:14 "I..."</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">There is ownership when Paul Uses the word I</span> <span>It implies it is personal, and when he says "the high calling" we know that this calling does not just belong to him alone.</span> <b>There is three kinds of willingness I want to point out by example:</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Willing To Go</span> <span>Consider Abraham as he packed up his family and went with no sure destination because God called him to do so</span> <b>Genesis 12:1 "Now the LORD had said unto Abram, Get thee out of thy country, and from thy kindred, and from thy father's house, unto a land that I will shew thee:"</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Reward: Abraham's Legacy</span> <span></span> <b> Genesis 15:5 “And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be.”</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Willing To Stand Up For Truth</span> <span></span> <b>My mom always said to me "If You dont stand for something, you will fall for anything"</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">This Brings Conviction</span> <span>You will never stand if you dont believe in what youre standing for</span> <b>James 1:6 “But let him ask in faith, nothing wavering. For he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea driven with the wind and tossed.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Consider Moses</span> <span>One man confronted the pharaoh of Egypt at God's request. </span> <b>His reward, God's presence on His Life</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Willing to Lead Others</span> <span>In Order to be a leader, you must first follow after Jesus Christ. Follow Him so closely that others are following Him by following you</span> <b>Joshua 24:15 “And if it seem evil unto you to serve the LORD, choose you this day whom ye will serve; whether the gods which your fathers served that were on the other side of the flood, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land ye dwell: but as for me and my house, we will serve the LORD.”</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">Reward: God gave great victories to Joshua</span> <span></span> <b>Joshua 1:9 “Have not I commanded thee? Be strong and of a good courage; be not afraid, neither be thou dismayed: for the LORD thy God is with thee whithersoever thou goest.”</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">When You Are Willing</span> <span></span> <b>God will give you a Godly legacy with His presence on your life and will ensure you get victory</b> </li></ul><h2>#2 To Receive God's Calling There Must Be Effort: --> "I Press"</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Decisions Must Be Made</span> <span>The true Christian is always making Faith based decisions. </span> <b>These decisions usually start small, and get bigger as our faith grows</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">How Faith Grows</span> <span>God speaks to us, telling us an area in our life we are holding back from Him and need to surrender. On Faith we do so, and God rewards our faitfulness causing us to trust Him on something a little bigger</span> <b>Faith Defined: Hebrews 11:1 “Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.”</b> </li></ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">There Will Be Resistance</span> <span>Make no mistake, there are those that would like nothing else to see you fail in your walk with God</span> <b>Paul understood this well: Philippians 1:28 “And in nothing terrified by your adversaries: which is to them an evident token of perdition, but to you of salvation, and that of God.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">One Day At A Time</span> <span>Let tomorrow worry about itself and let go of yesterday. Everyday has the ability to take us out if we stop with the fundamentals that Christ has taught us:</span> <b>Luke 9:23 “And he said to them all, If any man will come after me, let him deny himself, and take up his cross daily, and follow me.”</b> </li></ul><h2>#3 To Receive God's Calling It must be on purpose and with direction --> "...toward the mark..."</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">It's a Marathon, not a Sprint</span> <span>But your never going to make progress if your not in position and going the right direction</span> <b>2 Timothy 4:7 “I have fought a good fight, I have finished my course, I have kept the faith:”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Once on Track, Stay there</span> <span>There will be things in the way, some small and some big. </span> <b>Follow these two principles set forth by God and you will always be where youre supposed to be:</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">#1 Acknowledge Him when Choosing Your Path</span> <span>You really dont need to know if youre going to right way if you are always saying I am going this way to bring God Honor and Glory --> If your going to wrong way He will redirect you</span> <b>Proverbs 3:6 “In all thy ways acknowledge him, and he shall direct thy paths.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight">#2 Commit All that You Do To Him</span> <span>Struggling getting over the mental battle is sometimes the most challenging. God says if we commit all we do to Him, He will change our thoughts:</span> <b>Proverbs 16:3 “Commit thy works unto the LORD, and thy thoughts shall be established.”</b> </li></ul></ul><h2>There's Rewards for Answering His Call --> "for the prize"</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#1 A New Life</span> <span>Why I am called Sam --> Tired of Roland</span> <b> 2 Corinthians 5:17 “Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#2 A Long and Peaceful Life</span> <span>If youve never known peace you dont know what youre missing. It means no anxiety, emptiness</span> <b>Proverbs 3:1 “My son, forget not my law; but let thine heart keep my commandments: “For length of days, and long life, and peace, shall they add to thee.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#3 Your Deeds Will Be Blessed</span> <span>No more everything I touch goes to junk. Your deeds will bring happiness to your life when you are following Gods call on your life</span> <b>James 1:25 “But whoso looketh into the perfect law of liberty, and continueth therein, he being not a forgetful hearer, but a doer of the work, this man shall be blessed in his deed.”</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#4 God Will Manifest Himself To You</span> <span>Thats what John says in 14:21</span> <b> John 14:21 “He that hath my commandments, and keepeth them, he it is that loveth me: and he that loveth me shall be loved of my Father, and I will love him, and will manifest myself to him.”</b> </li></ul><h2>Are You In Position For God's Call?</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Everything Must be In His Order</span> <span>When we first start picking up the pieces of our lives we want it done all at once. </span> <b>Dont rush it, do it His way and it will be blessed</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#1 Get Saved</span> <span></span> <b>This is the only first step. If you dont know a time in your life where you got saved you can never be in position for God's call</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#2 Baptism</span> <span>This is the first step of obedience after salvation</span> <b>If you got baptized before salvation you just took a public bath. Baptism is after salvation</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#3 Becoming a Member of A New Testament Church</span> <span></span> <b>God will never trip you up, if you are being led here this morning then I submit to you that God is calling you to join right here</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">#4 Surrendering to God's will in your life</span> <span>Some of you may be called to be preachers, or teachers, or witnesses called to lead others out of the same pit of hell you were...</span> <b>But if you dont surrender to God's will in the small things, He will never trust you with the bigger things</b> </li><ul><li style="margin-left: 20px;"><span class="highlight"></span> <span></span> <b> Luke 16:10 “He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.”</b> </li></ul></ul><h2>One Step At A Time</h2><ul><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">Faith does not Grow overnight</span> <span>Take small steps, number 1 start with salvation. </span> <b>Dont worry about the other steps if you dont have this one first.</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">As You Obey God</span> <span>Your faith will grow. Then you will obey God on something bigger, the reward will be bigger and next thing you know your faith is Bigger. This is working out your own salvation:</span> <b>Philippians 2:12 “Wherefore, my beloved, as ye have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.”</b> </li></ul></body></html>
