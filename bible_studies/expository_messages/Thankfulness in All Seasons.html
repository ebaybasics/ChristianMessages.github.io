In this same way Paul is teaching us in what manner to pray...Prayer + Supplication + Thanksgiving</b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">1) Approach God With Humility </span> <span></span> <b>The very idea of Prayer is that you understand That He is God and has power to answer your request,</b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">2) Surrender Your Problem To Him</span> <span></span> <b>Another way of thinking of Supplication is pleading with God to answer your request. It's a picture of Surrendering it over to Him, and its the instruction Paul gives us</b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">3) Do so with Thanksgiving</span> <span></span> <b>Remember all that He has done, and will do</b> </li>
         <li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">4) Trust His Answer</span> <span></span> <b>Sometimes God closes doors that we were trying to go through. It is important to trust Him, because if we focus on the closed door we will miss the one He has opened for us</b> </li>
