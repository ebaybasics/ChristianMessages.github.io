His love is universal, not confined to a building or a social class. So, I say unto you, His love is for every soul here.</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">2. The Need To Pursue God</span> <span></span> <b>God can handle you skepticism - But He is real and desires a relationship with you. Test all things and hold fast to what is good. Scrutinize the Scriptures, study out the prophecies, and discern for yourself the unchanging character of God. The Bible can withstand your inquiries, for it is the inspired Word of a God who Himself is open to your questions.</b> </li><li style="margin-left: 0px;"><span class="highlight">3. The Continuous Journey</span> <span></span> <b>And to those who have already put their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ, this is no time for spiritual stagnancy. Let your love grow in knowledge and depth of insight. Dive deeper into the Holy Writ, and yearn for a fuller communion with the Lord. Remember, He didn't just save you to sit; He saved you to serve. So let us be His hands and feet to those less fortunate, reflecting His unwavering love in a world desperately in need of it.</b> </li></ul></body></html>
