                    <h3>Act 10:34  Then Peter opened his mouth, and said, Of a truth I perceive that God is no respecter of persons:  Act 10:35  But in every nation he that feareth him, and worketh righteousness, is accepted with him.  Act 10:36  The word which God sent unto the children of Israel, preaching peace by Jesus Christ: (he is Lord of all:)  Act 10:37  That word, I say, ye know, which was published throughout all Judaea, and began from Galilee, after the baptism which John preached;  Act 10:38  How God anointed Jesus of Nazareth with the Holy Ghost and with power: who went about doing good, and healing all that were oppressed of the devil; for God was with him.  Act 10:39  And we are witnesses of all things which he did both in the land of the Jews, and in Jerusalem; whom they slew and hanged on a tree:  Act 10:40  Him God raised up the third day, and shewed him openly;  Act 10:41  Not to all the people, but unto witnesses chosen before of God, even to us, who did eat and drink with him after he rose from the dead.  Act 10:42  And he commanded us to preach unto the people, and to testify that it is he which was ordained of God to be the Judge of quick and dead.  Act 10:43  To him give all the prophets witness, that through his name whosoever believeth in him shall receive remission of sins.  The Holy Spirit Falls on the Gentiles Act 10:44  While Peter yet spake these words, the Holy Ghost fell on all them which heard the word.  Act 10:45  And they of the circumcision which believed were astonished, as many as came with Peter, because that on the Gentiles also was poured out the gift of the Holy Ghost.  Act 10:46  For they heard them speak with tongues, and magnify God. Then answered Peter,  Act 10:47  Can any man forbid water, that these should not be baptized, which have received the Holy Ghost as well as we?  Act 10:48  And he commanded them to be baptized in the name of the Lord. Then prayed they him to tarry certain days. </h3>
