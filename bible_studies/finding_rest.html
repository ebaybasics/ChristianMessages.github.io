    <h3> Mat 11:28-30   Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. 
  Take my yoke upon you, and learn of me; for I am meek and lowly in heart: and ye shall find rest unto your souls. 
  For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. </h3>

            <li><span class="highlight">You must do it His way:</span><b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You must be born again:</span><b>Joh 3:3  Jesus answered and said unto him, Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. </b></li>

                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">You must know what keeps us separated from God:</span><b>Rom 6:23a   For the wages of sin is <u>death</u>;</b></li>

            <li><span class="highlight">This might be your last opportunity:</span><b>Jas 4:14 "Whereas ye know not what shall be on the morrow. For what is your life? It is even a vapour, that appeareth for a little time, and then vanisheth away. "</b></li>
