    <h4>The Foundation Series: 1 Cor 3:11 For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. </h4>
    <h1> Can God be Trusted:</h1>
    <h3> Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.  </h3>
    <ul>
        <h2>Intro: Hard to trust anymore ("If your like me..." speak of my personal experiences)</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Rough childhood</span> (Started using drugs at a young age)</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">So-called friends that claimed to be on your side</span> (People that had your back really had an interest in your wallet) <b>Pro 29:5  A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Even the world breaks trust when you tried to do the right things</span> (struggling with the most basic things like getting identification for a job)</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">God wants to intervene on your life</span> (But God requires our trust in Him, so lets consider the trustworthiness of God?) <b>Heb 11:6  But without faith it is impossible to please him: for he that cometh to God must believe that he is, and that he is a rewarder of them that diligently seek him. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>Who God says He is:</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">He claims to be creator of all</span><b>Joh 1:3  All things were made by him; and without him was not any thing made that was made. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">He claims to be able to give us a new life </span><b>2Co 5:17  Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all things are become new. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">He claims to be the provider of peace and rest</span><b>Mat 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="discussion">What does God mean by "heavy laden" - carrying a burden that we werent designed to carry alone</span></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>Evidences for Him:</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Personal testimony</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">The cohesiveness of the Bible </span> (There are over 66 books in the Bible, written over 2000 years apart but the character of God never changes.) <b>2Ti 3:16  All scripture is given by inspiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness: </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="discussion"> Imagine a book series was written 500 years ago in America. Would the main character behave the same 200 years ago as he would in todays version?</span></li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Prophecies that have come true</span> (Isaiah written 800 years before Jesus) <b>Isa 7:14  Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">God asks us to prove Him</span><b>Mal 3:10  Bring ye all the tithes into the storehouse, that there may be meat in mine house, and prove me now herewith, saith the LORD of hosts, if I will not open you the windows of heaven, and pour you out a blessing, that there shall not be room enough to receive it. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The reward of believing that He is who He says He is</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Eternal life:</span> (Its difficult to consider the importance) <b>Joh 10:28  And I give unto them eternal life; and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">The creator of the universe will be on your side:</span> (If the One who spoke the universe into existence is on your team who could stand against you?)<b>Rom 8:31  What shall we then say to these things? If God be for us, who can be against us? </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You will have reinforcements:</span> (Our action plan) <b>Gal 6:2  Bear ye one another's burdens, and so fulfil the law of Christ. </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="discussion">If you had someone on your team helping you get the things you need, would it make a difference?</span></li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The consequence for not believing Him</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Eternally separated from God:</span> (The Bible calls this eternal separation "death") <b>Rom 6:23  For the wages of sin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our Lord. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">The truth will be your judge:</span> (God put someone in your path with the truth)<b>Joh 12:48  He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him: the word that I have spoken, the same shall judge him in the last day. </b></li>
            <ul>
                <li><span class="discussion">What does Jesus mean when He says "the same shall judge him in the last day."</span></li>
            </ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">God designed it so none would have the excuse that they didnt know:</span> (Creation itself is evidence, no systems from randomness)<b>Rom_1:20  For the invisible things of him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being understood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and Godhead; so that they are without excuse:</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Weighing to risk\reward results</span>(small risk, big reward)</li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>How to receive God's promises in your life</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">It takes believing He is who He says He is and knowing He is the only way:</span> (Our text) <b>Joh 14:6  Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Knowing it is us who separated ourselves from God through sin:</span>(light cannot have fellowship with darkness)<b>Rom 3:23  For all have sinned, and come short of the glory of God; </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">God loved us in the thick of our sin, and He built the bridge for our relationship to be repaired:</span> Optional: Elaborate the Topic <b>Rom 5:8  But God commendeth his love toward us, in that, while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">That we should turn from our way to His:</span>(We must be tired of our way not working)<b> Mat 4:17  “From that time Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. “</b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">And accept Him into our hearts as our Lord and Saviour:</span>(It really is that simple, its us that overcomplicates it) <b>Rom 10:9  That if thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>Closing:</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Do you believe that God is who He says He is?</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Are you ready to leave this old life behind and receive a new life?</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Or will you reject God's intervention on your life</span></li>
