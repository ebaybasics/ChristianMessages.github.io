    <h1> Iron Shackles:</h1>
    <h3> Rom 6:14  For sin shall not have dominion over you: for ye are not under the law, but under grace. </h3>
    <ul>
        <h2>From Shackles to Ruin</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">The deception of sin</span> (When we first pursue pleasure, it is pleasurable for a season) <b>Heb 11:25  Choosing rather to suffer affliction with the people of God, than to enjoy the pleasures of sin for a season; </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Sin struggles mixed with deception</span> (After a while it becomes a lifestyle, some days tired of it) <b>Pro 4:19  The way of the wicked is as darkness: they know not at what they stumble. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Devastation of the shackles</span> (Been shackled so long, you dont even notice >> Given up) <b>Rom 1:24  Wherefore God also gave them up to uncleanness through the lusts of their own hearts, to dishonour their own bodies between themselves: </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The Characteristics of the Shackles</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">Origin of Sin</span> (Adam's willful decision to reject God's authority led to our imprisonment) <b>Rom 5:12  Wherefore, as by one man sin entered into the world, and death by sin; and so death passed upon all men, for that all have sinned: </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">The Shackles Bring Darkness</span> (Theres a reason why we ask "why is everything we try not working") <b>Joh 3:19  And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkness rather than light, because their deeds were evil. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Separated from God</span> (When shackled to sin, we are enemies of God. The one that we call to help we separate from) <b>Isa 59:2  But your iniquities have separated between you and your God, and your sins have hid his face from you, that he will not hear. </b></li>
        </ul>
        <ul>
        <h2>The Realization of Being Shackled - Hitting the Bottom</h2>
            <li><span class="highlight">No Longer Under the Illusion of Sin</span> (You start realizing how much sin has taken from you) <b>Isa 42:16  And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not; I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkness light before them, and crooked things straight. These things will I do unto them, and not forsake them. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Everything seems more difficult</span> (Sin has made even the most simple tasks (getting an id) difficult) <b>Mat 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and <span class="sub_highlight">are heavy laden</span>, and I will give you rest. </b></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Constantly Tired, Ready for Change</span> (This is where God wants us to be so He can intervene) <b>Mat 11:28  Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, <span class="sub_highlight">and I will give you rest. </span></b></li>
             <ul>
                <li><span class="discussion">Who is burned out with the way things are going?</span></li>
            </ul>
