    <h1> Approaching God:</h1>
    <h3>James 4:8-10 "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you. Cleanse your hands, ye sinners; and purify your
        hearts, ye double minded. Be afflicted, and mourn, and weep: let your laughter be turned to mourning, and your joy
        to heaviness. Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord, and he shall lift you up."</h3>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Question your motives for being here.</span> Did you come to use the house of God for your benefit? (I did too) God
            knows: <b>Isa 55:8</b> "For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, saith the LORD."</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">Maybe you don't know why you came:</span> <b>Php 2:13</b> "For it is God which worketh in you both to will and to do of
            his good pleasure."</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">If you came because you wanted to hear from God, you took a step toward Him.</span> God is not a liar, He draws closer
            to you. What are you going to do about it? <b>Psa 145:18</b> "The LORD is nigh unto all them that call upon him,
            to all that call upon him in truth."</li>
        </ul>

                    <ul>
                        <li>What do you think James means when he says to "Humble yourselves"? Why is that important?</li>

                    <li><b>Mat 6:33</b> "But seek ye first the kingdom of God, and his righteousness; and all these things

                against us?"
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You will never again be forsaken:</span> <b>Deuteronomy 31:6</b> "Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be
                afraid of them: for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail thee, nor forsake
                thee."

                <ul>
                    <li>If God loves us, What's keeping us separated from Him?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Answer</b>: Our sin is what seperates us from God</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li><b>Rom 6:16</b> "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
            yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of <span class="sub_highlight">sin unto death</span>, or of obedience
            unto righteousness?"</li>
                            <ul>
                                <li><span class="sub_highlight">The Bible calls this separation death</span> - we are dead to God by our own choosing, God doesn't want this: <b>Rom
            6:23</b> "For the wages of sin is death; but the <i>gift</i> of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
            Lord."</li>

            <ul>
                <li><b>Act 3:19</b> "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
            out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>What do you think the Bible means when it tells us to repent? Does that mean we need to be perfect or better before God will save us?</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Answer:</b>God simply means that we need to have a broken heart about our decisions, to understand that our way is killing us and His way leads to life</li>

                </ul>

        <h3><b>1Sa 2:8</b> "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them
            among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he
            hath set the world upon them."</h3>

            <li><span class="highlight">When you accept Christ, you accept an everlasting promise: </span><b>Joh 10:28</b> "And I give unto them eternal life;
            and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">It's time to start putting away old things, </span>once you accept God's salvation for you you are a new creation: <b>2Corinthians
            5:17</b> "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all
            things are become new."</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">You are a part of a royal family: </span>You are a part of the family of God. As a part of this family, you need to be active
            in His house: <b>Heb 10:25</b> "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is;
            but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You are not alone:</span> But you are only as good as your training.
            You must get involved in your training: <b>Pro 27:17</b> "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the
            countenance of his friend."</li>
