    <h1> Approaching God:</h1>
    <h3>James 4:8-10 "Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you."</h3>
    <ul>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Man’s Way of Salvation</span> Billy Sunday told of a man who came to him and said, "I will cut out the booze and get on the water wagon," "Good; what else?" "Of course, I am a gambler; I will quit gambling and I will never touch a pack of cards." "All right; what else?" "I am a bad man, and I will live a clean life." "Good; what else?" He said, "If I quit these things, I think they cover about all. I will quit drinking, swearing, stop gambling, and I will quit being impure." Billy said, "Good. Give me your hand and say you will accept Jesus Christ as your Savior," He said, "No, I will not. If I stop those things, I won’t need to do that.""</li>

        <h2>How to Approach God: and Make it Last</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">You must be saved. </span>What's keeping you separated from God? <b>Rom 6:16</b> "Know ye not, that to whom ye yield
            yourselves servants to obey, his servants ye are to whom ye obey; whether of <span class="sub_highlight">sin unto death</span>, or of obedience
            unto righteousness?"</li>
        <ul>
        <li><span class="sub_highlight">The Bible calls this separation death</span> - we are dead to God by our own choosing, God doesn't want this: <b>Rom
            6:23</b> "For the wages of sin is death; but the <i>gift</i> of God is eternal life through Jesus Christ our
            Lord."</li>
        </ul>
        <li><span class="highlight">Turn from your way to His:</span> <b>Act 3:19</b> "Repent ye therefore, and be converted, that your sins may be blotted
            out, when the times of refreshing shall come from the presence of the Lord;"</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">The answer is through Jesus Christ, will you accept it?</span> <b>Rom 10:13</b> "For whosoever shall call upon the name
            of the Lord shall be saved."</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>A New Walk</h2>
        <ul>
        <h3><b>1Sa 2:8</b> "He raiseth up the poor out of the dust, and lifteth up the beggar from the dunghill, to set them
            among princes, and to make them inherit the throne of glory: for the pillars of the earth are the LORD'S, and he
            hath set the world upon them."</h3>

            <li><span class="highlight">When you accept Christ, you accept an everlasting promise: </span><b>Joh 10:28</b> "And I give unto them eternal life;
            and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand."</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">It's time to start putting away old things, </span>once you accept God's salvation for you you are a new creation: <b>2Corinthians
            5:17</b> "Therefore if any man be in Christ, he is a new creature: old things are passed away; behold, all
            things are become new."</li>
        <li><span class="highlight">You are a part of a royal family: </span>You are a part of the family of God. As a part of this family, you need to be active
            in His house: <b>Heb 10:25</b> "Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the manner of some is;
            but exhorting one another: and so much the more, as ye see the day approaching."</li>
            <li><span class="highlight">You are not alone:</span> But you are only as good as your training.
            You must get involved in your training: <b>Pro 27:17</b> "Iron sharpeneth iron; so a man sharpeneth the
            countenance of his friend."</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Where Are You In This Walk?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight">Never took the first step</span></li>
            <li><span class="highlight">Took the first step, but it didn't stick</span></li>
        </ul>
